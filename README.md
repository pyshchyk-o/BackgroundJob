# Background Job for React Native iOS

A React Native project demonstrating how to set up a background job that fetches data from/to a remote API.

## Setup

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- Watchman
- Xcode (v11.3.1 or later)
- Cocoapods (v1.8.4 or later)
- React Native CLI

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/backgroundjob.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd backgroundjob`
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Navigate into the iOS directory: `cd ios`
5. Install the iOS dependencies: `pod install`
6. Return to the project directory: `cd ..`
7. Run the project on an iOS simulator: `npx react-native run-ios`

## Overview

The application registers a background job to periodically fetch data from a remote API and pass it to the UI. The background job is created using native iOS code and linked to React Native using a custom native module.

The module uses iOS's background fetch feature to periodically wake up the app and run the fetch job. When the job is completed, the module emits an event that the React Native code listens for. The React Native code then makes an API call and updates the UI with the fetched data.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, please try the following:

- Ensure all tools and dependencies are correctly installed and up to date.
- Check that your Xcode project is correctly configured, including the placement of the custom native module files.
- Make sure the API you are using is available and working correctly.
